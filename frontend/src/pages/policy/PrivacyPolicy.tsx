              <p className="mt-3">Welcome to <strong>COSMOS</strong> ("COSMOS," "we," "us," or "our"). COSMOS is a Collaborative Organized System for Multiple Operating Specialists, an integrated AI assistant platform developed and operated by Devosmic (collectively, the "Service").</p>
              <p className="mt-3">This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how Devosmic collects, uses, processes, shares, and protects Personal Data when you access or use our Service. It also explains your rights regarding your Personal Data.</p>
              <p className="mt-3">This Policy applies to all users of the COSMOS platform, including its website, applications, and related services. By accessing or using the Service, you signify your understanding of and agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use the Service.</p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <li><strong>Personal Data</strong>: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("Data Subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. For users of our Service, this primarily includes your email address and any personal information contained within the User Content you provide.</li>
                <li><strong>Processing</strong>: Any operation or set of operations which is performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal Data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Controller</strong>: The natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the Processing of Personal Data. For the purpose of this Policy, Devosmic is the Data Controller for the limited Personal Data it directly collects (e.g., email for login).</li>
                <li><strong>Data Processor</strong>: A natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes Personal Data on behalf of the Controller. Third-Party Services integrated with COSMOS may act as Data Processors or independent Data Controllers for the data they process, as outlined in Section 6.</li>
                <li><strong>User Content</strong>: Any data, information, documents (e.g., PDFs), URLs, YouTube links, email content, queries, or other materials that you upload, submit, provide, or make accessible to the Service for processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Services</strong>: Services not operated by Devosmic but integrated into or used by COSMOS to provide its functionality, such as AI model providers, and email service providers.</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="mt-3">COSMOS uses cookies and similar technologies to provide and secure our Service. Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website.</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-3 text-gray-300">
                <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These are necessary for the Service to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms (e.g., CSRF protection cookies, session cookies for authentication). You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Service will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information directly.</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics and Performance Cookies (If Used):</strong> We may in the future use cookies to collect information about how you use our Service, such as which pages you visit and if you experience any errors.

              <p className="mt-3">COSMOS is designed to leverage specialized Third-Party Services to provide its core AI functionalities. <strong className="text-violet-400">We do not sell your Personal Data.</strong> We share your information only in the limited circumstances described below:</p>

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-200">6.1. With Third-Party Service Providers (Data Processors or Independent Controllers):</h3>
              <p className="mt-3">To provide its features, COSMOS transmits User Content and queries to Third-Party Services. These services process your data to perform tasks on our (and your) behalf.</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2 text-gray-300">
                <li><strong>AI Model Providers:</strong> When you use the RAG Chatbot or the Gmail Response Assistant, your queries and relevant User Content (or Gmail Data) are sent to these providers to generate responses, embeddings, classifications, or summaries. These providers may act as Data Processors or independent Controllers depending on their terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Vector Database Provider:</strong> To enable the RAG Chatbot, processed and embedded representations of your User Content (from PDFs, URLs, YouTube) are stored in a Pinecone vector database. Pinecone acts as a Data Processor for this stored data.</li>
                <li><strong>Google (Gmail API):</strong> If you authorize the Gmail Response Assistant, COSMOS interacts with the Gmail API to fetch, analyze, and send emails on your behalf. Google processes your Gmail data according to its own privacy policy when you use its services.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Extraction Services:</strong> When you provide a URL, these tools may be used to fetch the content, which is then processed by COSMOS.</li>
                <li><strong>Hosting and Infrastructure Providers:</strong> We use third-party providers for hosting our application, databases (including the authentication database storing your email), and other infrastructure.</li>

              <p className="mt-3">We select these Third-Party Services carefully and, where they act as Data Processors, enter into agreements that require them to protect Personal Data. However, when your data is passed to these services (especially AI model providers for query processing), they may process it according to their own privacy policies and terms. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these Third-Party Services. <strong>You acknowledge that by using COSMOS, your User Content and queries will be processed by these Third-Party Services as an integral part of the Service's functionality.</strong></p>

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-200">6.2. For Legal Reasons:</h3>
              <p className="mt-3">We may disclose your Personal Data if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2 text-gray-300">
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation, subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>

              <p className="mt-3">In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Data, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Data.</p>

              <p className="mt-3">We may share your Personal Data for other purposes with your explicit consent.</p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-purple-500/30 pb-2">7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
              <p className="mt-3">We retain Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, and to operate and provide the Service.</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-3 text-gray-300">
                <li><strong>Account Information (Email Address):</strong> We retain your email address as long as your COSMOS account is active or as needed to provide you with the Service. If you close your account, we will delete your email address from our active systems, subject to any legal retention obligations or needs for backup/archival purposes for a limited period.</li>
                <li><strong>User Content Processed for RAG (in Pinecone):</strong> The embedded representations of your uploaded documents, URLs, and YouTube transcripts stored in Pinecone are maintained to provide you with the RAG chatbot functionality. You can manage (e.g., delete specific sources) this content through the Service interface if such features are available, or by requesting deletion. Upon account termination, this associated processed content in Pinecone will be scheduled for deletion.</li>
                <li><strong>Gmail Data:</strong> COSMOS does not persistently store your Gmail messages. It accesses them via Google OAuth 2.0 tokens to perform actions as you direct. You can revoke COSMOS's access to your Gmail account at any time through your Google account settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> Log data is typically retained for a limited period (90 days) for security, troubleshooting, and operational analysis, after which it is deleted or anonymized.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-3">You may request deletion of your Personal Data by contacting us as described in Section 13.</p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-purple-500/30 pb-2">8. Security Measures</h2>
              <p className="mt-3">Devosmic takes the security of your Personal Data seriously. We implement a variety of technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the Personal Data we process from unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-3 text-gray-300">
                <li>Encryption of data in transit (e.g., HTTPS/TLS).</li>
                <li>Secure authentication mechanisms and CSRF protection.</li>
                <li>Access controls to limit access to Personal Data to authorized personnel.</li>
                <li>Regular review of our security practices.</li>
                <li>Use of reputable Third-Party Service providers with their own robust security practices.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-3">However, please be aware that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your Personal Data, especially data transmitted to or from the Service over the Internet or data processed by Third-Party Services. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials.</p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-purple-500/30 pb-2">9. Your Rights (Under GDPR and other applicable laws)</h2>

              <p className="mt-3">Where we transfer Personal Data outside of jurisdictions like the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the data, such as by using Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission, relying on adequacy decisions, or other lawful transfer mechanisms. By using the Service, you consent to such transfers, provided that appropriate safeguards are in place.</p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 border-b border-purple-500/30 pb-2">11. Children's Privacy</h2>
